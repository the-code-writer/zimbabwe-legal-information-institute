\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong>This is an appeal against the judgment of the High\u00a0Court sitting at Masvingo delivered on 24\u00a0June 2020 which dismissed with costs the application made by the two appellants for a declaratory order and an interdict.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>FACTUAL BACKGROUND<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two appellants are sugar producing giants in the Lowveld while the first\u00a0respondent is the statutory body charged with revenue collection in Zimbabwe.\u00a0 The remainder of the respondents are either sugar cane farmers or associations representing such farmers.\u00a0 The respondents will be referred to in this judgment for convenience, as Zimbabwe\u00a0Revenue Authority and the farmers respectively.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants and the farmers entered into two types of agreements, either a \u201ccane milling agreement\u201d or a \u201ccane purchase agreement\u201d in terms of which the appellants would either provide milling services to the farmers and market their sugar and molasses or outrightly purchase the sugar cane.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The dispute which arose between the parties did not involve the outright purchase and sale of sugar cane.\u00a0 As such this judgment does not deal with that scenario at all.\u00a0 The judgment concerns itself with the cane milling agreements entered into between the parties.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In terms of the cane milling agreements, the charge for milling and marketing services payable by the farmers to the appellants was calculated in terms of a pre-determined ratio referred to as the \u201cDivision of Proceeds\u201d (DoP) ratio.\u00a0 It was fixed at 23 percent of the proceeds the farmers would get, meaning that the appellants would retain 23 percent of the proceeds while remitting the balance of 77 percent to the farmers.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regrettably, in fixing the milling and marketing charge, the appellants did not include Value Added Tax (VAT) as required by law.\u00a0 It follows that no Value Added Tax was paid by the appellants to Zimbabwe Revenue Authority in that regard.\u00a0 It was in the process of auditing the appellants\u2019 VAT assessments for the period 2009 to 2017 that Zimbabwe Revenue Authority decided that the milling and marketing charges of 23\u00a0percent of the proceeds levied by the appellants against the farmers attracted VAT.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zimbabwe Revenue Authority proceeded to issue assessments of VAT for those years and demanded payment of same from the appellants.\u00a0 These assessments related to the past supplies where the appellants ought to have, but failed to, collect and remit VAT to Zimbabwe Revenue Authority.\u00a0 The appellants objected to the assessments which objections were all disallowed by Zimbabwe Revenue Authority.\u00a0 The appellants appealed to the Fiscal Appeals Court but paid the assessed VAT to Zimbabwe Revenue Authority notwithstanding.\u00a0 An appeal does not exonerate a tax payer from paying the assessed tax.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After effecting payments to Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, the appellants sought to recover such VAT from the farmers on the basis that they were obliged to charge and collect the VAT from the consumers of the service, the farmers, but had not done so.\u00a0 The appellants were of the view that it was only fair and reasonable that the farmers should re-imburse them of the VAT paid by them to Zimbabwe Revenue Authority.\u00a0 There being no convergence between the farmers, who had obtained advice from Zimbabwe Revenue Authority that the 23\u00a0percent Division of Proceeds ratio was inclusive of VAT, and the appellants, the latter filed an application in the court <em>a quo<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In their application the appellants sought declaratory relief that they were legally entitled to continue charging and collecting VAT from the farmers over and above the 23\u00a0percent milling charge.\u00a0 The appellants also sought to be re-imbursed the monies they paid to Zimbabwe Revenue Authority on past assessments.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, they accused Zimbabwe Revenue Authority of interfering with contractual issues between them and the farmers by rendering advice to the farmers on the VAT dispute.\u00a0 Accordingly the appellants sought an order interdicting Zimbabwe Revenue Authority from what they called \u201cgratuitously interfering in pricing and contractual issues\u201d between them and the farmers.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The application was opposed by Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and most of the respondents.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>DECISION <em>A QUO<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was the view of the court <em>a quo<\/em> that the entire dispute revolved around the interpretation of s 69 and s 72 of the Value Added Tax Act [<em>Chapter 23:12<\/em>].\u00a0 Regarding the past supplies of sugar cane to the appellants the court <em>a quo<\/em> found that the literal meaning of s\u00a069 of the Act suggests that it is irrelevant whether the registered operator has charged VAT or not.\u00a0 If the price does not reflect the tax component, s 69 operates such that there is a presumption that a price not reflecting VAT included that tax.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was the finding of the court <em>a quo<\/em> that the section serves to \u201cestop\u201d a registered operator, who has not reflected VAT on the price, from denying that the price includes that tax.\u00a0 It also found that s 69 precludes such registered operator from subsequently claiming VAT not reflected on the price.\u00a0 In the court <em>a quo<\/em>\u2019s view, permitting the appellants to recoup VAT in retrospect would render nugatory the deeming provision of s 69 as the deeming provision cannot be interpreted to mean different things to two different people.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding the claim for VAT on present and future supplies of sugar cane which the contracts of the parties are still silent on, the court <em>a quo<\/em> took the view that it was up to the parties to renegotiate or clarify the terms of their contracts in order to plug the existing <em>lacunae<\/em>.\u00a0 If they do not, then s 69 of the Act will continue to apply.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court <em>a quo<\/em> was not persuaded that a case was made for an interdict against the first respondent.\u00a0 It recognised that the appellants had made a formal request to the first\u00a0respondent to intervene and educate the farmers on the tax implications of their agreement.\u00a0 They could not thereafter cry foul after such intervention.\u00a0 In addition, the court <em>a\u00a0quo<\/em> found no evidence of the first respondent\u2019s interference with the pricing issues between the appellants and the farmers.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the question of costs the court <em>a quo<\/em> found no basis for departing from the general rule that costs follow the result.\u00a0 It dismissed the application with costs granted in favour of only those respondents who participated in the suit.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The appellants were aggrieved.\u00a0 They noted this appeal to this Court on the following grounds;<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>GROUNDS OF APPEAL<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol><li>The learned judge of the court <em>a quo<\/em> erred and misdirected himself in finding that s 69 of<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>the Value Added Tax Act [<em>Chapter 23:12<\/em>] operated to preclude the appellants from recovering VAT for past supplies on an alleged milling service which first respondent considered to have been rendered to farmers.<\/p>\n<ol><li>Further the court <em>a quo<\/em> erred and misdirected itself in failing to pronounce definitively<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>on the appellant\u2019s right and entitlement to charge, levy and collect VAT, and the farmer\u2019s respective obligation to pay same, in addition to the value of the alleged milling service with respect to current and future supplies pursuant to the first respondent\u2019s decision to impose tax.<\/p>\n<ol><li>The learned Judge of the court <em>a quo<\/em> erred and misdirected himself in failing to find that<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>the letter by the first respondent to the farmers with respect to the farmers\u2019 tax obligations strayed upon purely contractual matters which it was not competent for the first respondent to prescribe to parties.<\/p>\n<ol><li>The court <em>a quo<\/em> erred in awarding costs against the appellants and in favour of the<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>respondents in general and at any rate most especially as it relates to second, fifth, seventh, eighth and tenth respondents in

appeal may be four but they speak to essentially two narrow issues for determination in this appeal.\u00a0 They are:<\/p>\n<ol><li>Whether or not the court <em>a quo<\/em> erred in refusing to grant the declaratur and the interdict.<\/li>\n<li>Whether or not the court <em>a quo<\/em> erred in granting costs against the appellants.<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>SUBMISSIONS ON

the legal effects of the decision taken by the first\u00a0respondent contained in its letter dated 9\u00a0September\u00a02019.\u00a0 Following meetings held by the parties the first respondent determined that:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c1. The VAT Act under section 6 provides that VAT shall be charged and levied<\/p>\n<p>where a service is provided.\u00a0 Facts at hand indicated that millers provide milling services to the farmers and they retain 23% from the sugar proceeds<\/p>\n<p>.......<\/p>\n<p>Given the above legislative requirements VAT is therefore applicable on the milling fees and as discussed in the meeting VAT is recovered as depicted in the following scenario......\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was submitted that the moment the first respondent made the decision to commence recovering VAT on milling services when, prior to that it had not done so, the provisions of s 72(1) of the Act were triggered.\u00a0 The section provides:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c(1) Whenever the value added tax is imposed or increased in respect of any supply of goods or services in relation to which any agreement was entered into by the acceptance of an offer made before the tax was imposed or increased, as the case may be, the registered operator may, unless agreed to the contrary in any agreement in writing and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law, recover from the recipient, as an addition to the amounts payable by the recipient to the registered operator, a sum equal to any amount payable by the registered operator by way of the said tax on increase, as the case may be, and any amount so recoverable by the registered operator shall, whether it is recovered or not, be accounted for by the registered operator under this Act as part of the consideration in respect of the said supply.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To the extent that VAT was only imposed on the milling fees by letter quoted above, so the argument goes, when it had not been claimed previously, the appellants were entitled to recover it from the recipients of the milling services by virtue of that provision.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was submitted further that the deeming provisions of s 69 do not preclude the appellants from recovering the VAT paid to the first respondent.\u00a0 This is so because the section is a shield in the hands of the revenue collector.\u00a0 It is an administrative tool for the facilitation of easy collection of taxes without disruptive disputes with registered operators.\u00a0 In Mr <em>Moyo\u2019s<\/em> view, s 69 cannot be used to estop the operator from recovering VAT paid to the collector.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <em>Per contra<\/em>, Mr <em>Magwaliba<\/em> for the first respondent submitted that given that the contracts for milling services did not reflect VAT, s 69 of the Act applies.\u00a0 To that extent, in respect of past supplies, the contract price is deemed to be inclusive of VAT.\u00a0 It was submitted further that in the absence of an agreement with the farmers to vary the contract price, even by the application of basic principles of contract law, the appellants could not unilaterally vary the price by levying VAT.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the effects of s 72 of the Act, it was submitted that the section may be regarded as a law \u2013 changing provision.\u00a0 In the event that the law changes to include VAT where it was not applicable, so it was argued, or to increase the applicable VAT, then by dint of s 72, the agreement is varied accordingly.\u00a0 The net effect of those submissions is that the section has no application where VAT was excluded in the agreement when it should have been included.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regarding the alleged interference with contractual rights and obligations by the first respondent, Mr <em>Magwaliba<\/em> submitted that the advice rendered by the first respondent was not only at the invitation of the appellants themselves but also in fulfilment of a statutory obligation.\u00a0 The first respondent is obliged to educate tax payers on their tax obligations.\u00a0 The requirements for an interdict were not met.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Counsel for the rest of the respondents in attendance, in

In as much as the record of appeal and the submissions made by counsel are heavy, what has to be decided has become very narrow indeed.\u00a0 The entire appeal turns on the effect of the deeming provision in s 69.\u00a0 In particular, whether it operates to prevent a registered operator who has fallen foul of the law by not reflecting VAT on the price of goods and services, from later recouping the VAT demanded by the first respondent from the consumer.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <em>A fortiori<\/em>, whether s 72 applies to a

price.\u00a0 Section 72 varies the contract price by the margin of VAT imposed or increased subsequent to the contract being concluded.\u00a0 I agree with Mr <em>Magwaliba<\/em> that it is a

(Private) Limited <\/em>2016(2) ZLR 84(S) at 85 D-F thus:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe system of collection of VAT as embodied in the VAT Act, involves the imposition of tax at each step along the chain of manufacture of goods or the provision of services subject to VAT.\u00a0 Consequently, every registered operator is required in terms of s 28 of the VAT Act, to submit returns to the Commissioner of Taxes (\u2018the Commissioner\u2019) every month, calculate the VAT due on the return and make payment of such VAT.\u00a0 Due to the sheer volume and complexity of the VAT collection system, ZIMRA lacks the capacity and manpower to effectively monitor each and every transaction liable to VAT and as a consequence it is heavily reliant on the self-assessment process by registered operators.\u00a0 However, in order to ensure that operators comply with the requirements to render returns and collect VAT, ZIMRA conducts periodic investigations as well as audits.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In terms of the VAT collection system which is in place, while the burden to pay resides with the consumer of goods and services, the registered operator bears the burden of collecting VAT and remitting it to the revenue collector.\u00a0 Where the registered operator has omitted as required by s\u00a06(1) of the Value Added Tax Act, to include VAT on the price, s\u00a069(1) is activated to deem VAT to be included in whatever price is pegged by the operator.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section 6(1) is very clear in its wording, it provides:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSubject to this Act, there shall be charged, levied and collected, for the benefit of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a tax at such rate as may be fixed by the Charging Act on the value of-<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ol><li>the supply by any registered operator of goods or services supplied by him on or after the 1st January 2004, in the course or furtherance of any trade carried on by him:\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What it means is that by failing to charge, levy and collect VAT from the consumers of their milling services the appellants breached, to their peril, the peremptory provisions of s 6(1) of The Act.\u00a0 By operation of s 69(1) the 23 percent charge for milling services was taken to include VAT for all intents and purposes.\u00a0 The court <em>a quo<\/em> cannot be faulted for finding that, whether by inadvertence, oversight or misinterpretation of the nature of the contract, the consequence of the failure to specifically include VAT are that it is deemed included in the milling price.\u00a0 The deeming provision cannot be applied differently on the registered operator and the consumer.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As regards the question whether s 72(1) rescues the appellants from the consequences of their failure to comply with the peremptory provisions of s 6(1)(a), it is clearly a matter of statutory interpretation.\u00a0 In my view the simple grammatical meaning of the words \u201cwhenever the value added tax is imposed or increased in respect of any supply of goods and services ....\u201d is that, in the first instance, there would be no tax on such supply and the law steps in to impose a tax.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the second instance the law would have imposed a tax on the supply but it moves in to increase the value of tax.\u00a0 In both instances the parties would have contracted in certain terms before the law changes.\u00a0 Upon change of the law, s 72(1) comes in to vary the terms of a pre-existing contract to either impose or increase the tax.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I do not agree with Mr <em>Moyo\u2019s<\/em> submission that upon conducting an audit which revealed that the appellants were rendering a taxable milling service while not levying and collecting tax, the first respondent imposed a tax.\u00a0 In my view the law had already imposed the tax but the appellants were committing an infraction by not reflecting it.\u00a0 Again, the court <em>a quo<\/em> was correct in concluding that there was no imposition of a \u201cnew tax\u201d nor an increase of chargeable tax.\u00a0 Accordingly s 72(1) has no application and is certainly not available to the appellant.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr <em>Moyo<\/em> did not prosecute the issue of the interdict sought against the first\u00a0respondent with any degree of enthusiasm.\u00a0 It is not without reason that this is so.\u00a0 Firstly, evidence placed before the court <em>a quo<\/em> shows that the appellants invited the first\u00a0respondent to intervene and educate the farmers on the tax implications of their contracts with the appellants.\u00a0 That the first respondent interpreted their contracts in a manner not favourable to the appellants can scarcely found a cause of action.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Secondly, and more importantly, the requirements for the grant of an interdict were not met.\u00a0 I can only advert to the fact that the court <em>a quo<\/em> made factual findings relating to the failure by the appellants to prove that the first\u00a0respondent had interfered with the contractual issues.\u00a0 It also made a finding that the advice rendered by the first\u00a0respondent was only confined to VAT matters falling within the statutory province of the first respondent as a revenue collector.\u00a0 Surely one cannot be interdicted from carrying out a lawful duty.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The court <em>a quo<\/em> also made a finding that the use of the term \u201cgratuitously interfering\u201d was too imprecise and unenforceable.\u00a0 On appeal the appellants failed to set out a basis for interference with those findings.\u00a0 It is trite that it is only where the factual findings of the lower court are clearly irrational to an extent that no sensible court seized with the same facts could have reached such a conclusion that the appellate court will interfere.\u00a0 See <em>Hama v National Railways of Zimbabwe<\/em> 1996(1) ZLR 664 (S), <em>Shuro v Chiuraise<\/em> SC\u00a020\/19.\u00a0 No such threshold was attained in the present case.\u00a0 As such this Court cannot interfere.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It remains for me to deal with the question of costs.\u00a0 The court <em>a quo<\/em> granted costs against the appellants in favour of those respondents who participated in the proceedings.\u00a0 It premised its decision on the general rule that costs follow the result.\u00a0 Its attention was not drawn to the widely held principle in tax cases that the High Court or the Special Court is loathe to make an order as to costs save where the claim is held to be unreasonable or the grounds of appeal are frivolous.\u00a0 See s 65(12) of Income Tax Act [<em>Chapter 23:06<\/em>].<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On appeal, counsel again did not address that issue at all.\u00a0 It occurs to me that the court <em>a quo<\/em> was incapacitated in respect of costs by the failure to bring its attention to the prevailing jurisprudence on such costs.\u00a0 As a result it misdirected itself, a misdirection entitling this Court to interfere with its exercise of discretion.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is nothing in this case suggesting that the appellants\u2019 case was unreasonable or that it was frivolous.\u00a0 Quite to the contrary, they raised quite pertinent issues which required the court to embark on detailed interpretation of the law.\u00a0 The same applies to the appeal.\u00a0 In my view this is a classic case in which the costs both <em>a quo<\/em> and in this Court should not be awarded to any party.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the result it be and is hereby ordered as follows:<\/p>\n<ol><li>The appeal in respect of grounds of appeal 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 is dismissed<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 with each party to bear its own costs.<\/p>\n<p>2.
